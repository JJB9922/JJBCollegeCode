These are the files from my college coursework project, a VBA and Microsoft Access based booking system.

The brief for the coursework was quite simple - pick a practical way that a database system could be used and implement it with documentation.

I chose to create an automatic booking system for a music practice venue / community centre that I spent a lot of time at in my teens.

Please note the extensive technical documentation, running through R&D to Prototyping to Testing.

P.s. No excuses for the awful colour pallette!
